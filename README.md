## Motivation
Almost every large SPA or project involves date and time input. Browser's native implementations of those are inconsistent and limited in functionality. Most other libraries require you to pull in heavy dependencies like jQuery, Bootstrap, and moment.js. I wanted something that was good-looking out of the box, dependency-free, powerful, and extensible.

Feature overview:

- Dependency-free (no bloated bundles)
- Simple, polished UX
- Date + time input
- Range selections
- Ability to select multiple dates
- Can be used as just a time picker
- Display dates in a human-friendly format
- Easily disable specific dates, date ranges, or any date using arbitrary logic
- Week numbers
- 51 locales
- 8 colorful themes (incl. dark and material)
- Numerous plugins
- Libraries available for React, Angular, Vue, Ember, and more
